# DeepLearning
This is a repo is dedicated to the basics of Deep Learning and Neural Networks. This repo contains, sequential models for deep neural networks and with activation functions like ReLu, elu, gelu etc. The Sequential Model is trained on the Red Wine Data Set, to predict the quality of the wine.
